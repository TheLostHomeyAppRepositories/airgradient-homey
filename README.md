# AirGradient
Join Us in the Fight Against Air Pollution
Seven million people die every year due to air pollution. Monitoring air quality enables people worldwide to better protect themselves.

We are on a mission to bring accurate and affordable air quality monitoring to every corner of the planet and we are supported by a community of more than 10,000 engaged citizens who have already deployed an AirGradient monitor.

To maximize our impact, we have completely open-sourced and shared our monitor design so that others can build upon it.
